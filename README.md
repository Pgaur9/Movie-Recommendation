# Movie-Recommendations

## Title: Eagle Movies Database (EMDB)

**Team:** Dejoy, Pooja and Lamont.

**Summary:**
For our project, our team developed a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of a movie search application that connects to The Movie Database (TMDB) API. We identified four key data points to implement in our application: movie poster, movie title, movie rating, and overview. The application allows users to enter a search term for a movie title, and it returns relevant movies based on their query, displayed in a grid layout in the browser.

The interface uses Bootstrap cards to display each movie result. Each card prominently features the movie poster, with the movie title and rating displayed below. The movie ratings are color-coded to visually indicate quality: green for ratings 7.0 and higher, yellow for ratings between 7.0 and 4.0, and red for ratings below 4.0. The overview data is presented in a mouseover event, which displays the overview text over the entire card when hovered over.

The interface is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. On a desktop monitor, the interface displays five cards per row, scaling down to one card per row on a mobile screen.
